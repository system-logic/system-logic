M-01: Memory-Optimal Computation

This model observes the relationship between physical signal precision
and numerical representation in computational systems.

In many real-world setups, the effective information content is bounded
by physical measurement limits (for example, sensor resolution).

In such cases, numerical representations may carry significantly more
capacity than the underlying signal can meaningfully support.
This mismatch introduces hidden assumptions about precision,
stability, and resource usage.

The model highlights how representation choices
implicitly encode beliefs about the system being modeled,
rather than prescribing specific data types or implementations.
