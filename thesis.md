## 1. Motivation

Modern systems operate under permanent uncertainty.

Most failures are not caused by lack of intelligence, but by incorrect assumptions about constraints.

This work focuses on how decisions are engineered, not how outcomes are predicted.

## 2. Core position

Decisions are made under:

* Incomplete information
* Noisy signals
* Irreversible consequences
* Bounded resources

Therefore, decision systems must be designed around failure modes, not success scenarios.

## 3. Uncertainty

Uncertainty is not noise to be removed.

It is a structural property of complex systems.

Attempts to eliminate uncertainty usually increase fragility.

## 4. Constraints

Every real system is constrained by:

* Capital
* Time
* Information
* Computation
* Human behavior

Ignoring constraints does not remove them. It only hides their impact until failure.

## 5. Trade-offs

There are no optimal decisions.

There are only acceptable trade-offs.

Optimization without explicit trade-offs produces brittle systems.

## 6. Implementation

Decision logic must be executable.

If a model cannot be implemented, it cannot be trusted.

Implementation exposes hidden assumptions.

## 7. Failure

Failure is not an exception.

It is a signal.

Systems that do not record failure modes repeat them.

## 8. Scope

Markets, infrastructure, security, automation, and any system where decisions have cost.

This is not domain-specific.

Domains are interchangeable; logic is not.

## 9. Open questions

* How to design systems that degrade gracefully?
* How to detect regime shifts early?
* How to encode human judgment into constrained systems?

These questions remain open by design.

## 10. Closing note

This document is not final.

Changes will be tracked.

Revisions are expected.

The goal is clarity, not completeness.
