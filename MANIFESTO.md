# Decision Logic Lab  
**Manifesto**

## Scope

Decision Logic Lab documents **architectural and decision-making thinking**  
through concrete, real-world projects explored as research artifacts.

This is a **research log**, not an educational product.

The goal is to expose the structure, constraints, and evolution of decisions —  
not to teach, prescribe, or generalize.

---

## What This Work Is

- A public record of architectural reasoning in specific contexts  
- A demonstration of how decisions are born, break, and get revised  
- A laboratory-style archive: ideas · structures · boundaries

---

## What This Work Is NOT

- Not a tutorial  
- Not a course  
- Not a collection of best practices  
- Not a set of reusable templates  
- Not advice for building your own system

If after engaging with the material you feel  
**“now I know how to build this”**  
— the format has failed its purpose.

## Public Content (Open)

**What is included**

- Architectural structures and high-level block diagrams  
- Algorithmic and system-level schematics  
- Minimal, illustrative (non-composable) code snippets

**What is intentionally excluded**

- End-to-end pipelines  
- Full integrations  
- Formalized decision rules  
- Metrics, optimization targets, or prescriptions

The public layer exists to reveal **structure**, not execution.

## Private Content (Restricted Access)

**What may be included**

- Formalized trade-offs  
- Alternatives that were explicitly rejected  
- Boundaries of applicability  
- Reasons for abandoning or rolling back decisions  
- Architectural risks under growth, scale, or change

Restricted access does **not** promise more code.  
Depth here means **responsibility**, not completeness.

---

## Responsibility Boundary

Understanding structure does not grant permission to apply it.

Every architecture shown exists **only within its original context**.  
Applying it elsewhere transfers full responsibility to the observer.

The work is deliberately shaped so that you arrive at this conclusion:

> You understand the system —  
> and you also understand why using it without the architect is risky.

---

## Tone and Method

- No universal claims  
- No decision trees  
- No generalizations  
- No comparisons framed as “better” or “worse”

Statements of the form  
*“in systems like this, one should…”*  
are intentionally avoided.

## Access Model

This project follows an **open core / closed depth** model.

- Open materials establish proof of work  
- Restricted materials formalize responsibility

Access to restricted materials is offered via GitHub Sponsors.  
There are no promises of frequency, support, or specific outcomes.

## Final Test

After spending time with this work, the desired takeaway is:

> “I understand the structure —  
> and I understand that applying it is a responsibility I must consciously accept.”

Any other conclusion signals a mismatch between intent and perception.
