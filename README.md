## Decision Logic Lab

This repository is the central workspace of **Decision Logic Lab**.

It documents applied reasoning about decision systems under uncertainty —
how constraints, trade-offs, and real conditions shape architectural and strategic decisions.

This is a **thinking space**, not a product.

For scope, boundaries, and responsibility limits, see the manifesto:

👉 **[Decision Logic Lab — Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md)**

## What this repository is

- A curated body of notes on how decisions are engineered under uncertainty
- A place to formalize assumptions, constraints, and trade-offs
- A long-term laboratory for reasoning about systems, not for teaching or advising

The focus is not prediction, optimization, or performance chasing.  
The focus is **robust decision-making under real constraints**.

---

## What this repository is not

- Not a framework
- Not a library
- Not a trading strategy
- Not educational content for beginners
- Not opinions without consequences

If you are looking for ready-made answers or reusable solutions,
this repository is not intended for that purpose.

## Structure and core documents

This repository is intentionally structured as a single source of truth.

- `thesis.md` — central decision logic and worldview
- `assumptions.md` — explicit assumptions (temporary and revisable)
- `constraints.md` — hard limits and unavoidable trade-offs
- `models/` — abstract models of decision systems
- `experiments/` — links to real implementations and tests
- `failures.md` — documented errors and incorrect decisions

Each document exists to clarify **why decisions were made**, not to prescribe what others should do.

---

## Working principles

- **Constraints** > ideas  
- **Trade-offs** > optimality  
- **Robustness** > performance  
- **Reasoning** > prediction  
- **One source of truth**

## Status

This repository is intentionally incomplete.

It evolves slowly and documents decisions that were made,
including revisions, rollbacks, and failures —
not just ideas that were explored.
