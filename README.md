## Decision Logic Lab

Applied reasoning about decision systems under uncertainty. Constraints, trade-offs, real implementations.

This repository is a thinking space, not a product. It exists to map technical constraints to decision models and to keep a single source of truth.

---

### What this is

* A curated body of notes on how decisions are engineered under uncertainty
* A place to formalize assumptions, constraints, and trade-offs
* A long-term laboratory for reasoning, not tutorials or advice

**The focus is not prediction, optimization, or performance chasing.** The focus is robust decision-making under real constraints.

---

### What this is not

* Not a framework
* Not a library
* Not a trading strategy
* Not educational content for beginners
* Not opinions without consequences

> If you are looking for ready-made answers, this repository is not intended for you.

### Core documents

* `thesis.md` — central decision logic and worldview
* `assumptions.md` — explicit assumptions (temporary, revisable)
* `constraints.md` — hard limits and unavoidable trade-offs
* `models/` — abstract models of decision systems
* `experiments/` — links to real implementations and tests
* `failures.md` — documented errors and incorrect decisions

---

### Working principles

* **Constraints** > ideas
* **Trade-offs** > optimality
* **Robustness** > performance
* **Reasoning** > prediction
* **One source of truth**

### Status

This repository is intentionally incomplete. It evolves slowly and documents decisions that were made, not just ideas that were explored.
